# 1. Linux Distributions

1. Versions/types/kinds/flavors of Linux operating system are called Linux Flavors/Distributions (also called Linux Distro).

    1. Ubuntu
    2. Debian
    3. Red hat
    4. Fedora

```
**mkdir -p**

1. Sometimes when you want to create a directory, its parent directory or directories might not exist.
2. With the help of mkdir -p command you can create sub-directories of a directory. 
3. It will create parent directory first, if it doesn't exist. 
4. But if it already exists, then it will not print an error message and will move further to create sub-directories.
